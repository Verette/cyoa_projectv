      <p> Mass Transit is a wonderful tool that’s utilized to get people from one place to another. There are tons of places all over the world that have a Mass Transit system. Some places go as far as to even build and plan around their transit systems because they’re just that important. There are so many benefits to be had from it, and yet here in America there’s not much transit to be had, if any at all.</p>
      <p> On the next page I will feature interviews from people on their opinions of Mass Transit. By doing this I intend to learn how people feel about Mass Transit and if they think they truly need it or not, or if what exists needs improvement.<p/>
