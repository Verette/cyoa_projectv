      <p> Mass Transit is a wonderful tool that’s utilized to get people from one place to another. There are tons of places all over the world that even build and plan around their transit systems because they’re that important. It’s also a lot more eco friendly compared to cars. There are so many benefits to be had from it, and yet here in America there’s not much transit if any at all.</p>
